Hi! I'm San Sequeira. <img width="40px" src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/wave.gif" />

<br>

#### About
I've got a Master's in Computer Science.

<br>

#### Things I like dabbling in :
 - Philosophy,
 - Programming Languages and Compilers, 
 - Logic,
 - Kernels (the OS kind)
 - Films

<br>

#### Here's what I'm Exploring lately (not at the same time, and not in that order!) :
- Category + Type Theory + Logic
- Rust (and C/C++ ofc)
- Haskell
- OCaml
- Model Checking

<br>

#### What I'm intending to build/design <img width="45px" src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/Developer.gif" /> :
- A blog for my opinions about the many things that catch my attention
- A site for navigating CS the way I would've liked it (slightly oritented more towards PLT and compilers)
